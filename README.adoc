= TinyGFX
The minimal graphics engine

== Description

TinyGFX is a small experimental graphics engine to try out the low-level features of
modern graphics APIs. Here are some highlights of current functionality

* WIP

== Development

The battle tested cmake commands work for building the project:

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make -j<cores>
----

However, a convenience Makefile has been shipped in the root that will create a debug
build. This can be run as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ make -j<cores> all
----
